##A Strategic Lesson on Free Legal Documents

Over the weekend, I read an [interesting article](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/10/documents-just-want-to-be-free/)by Daniel Doktori detailing why some law firms are providing free legal documents online. Doktori and others argue that law firms, mimicking the "freemium" model of many of their startup clients, do so for various reasons including marketing, branding, and altruism. The most compelling argument centers on signaling firm quality:

>The sites also convey a message about the scale and quality of the sponsoring law firm: It has the scale to afford giving away the once-“secret sauce” and the quality to bet doing so won’t cannibalize business. That message is founded upon the idea that law is a service, not a product. As one lawyer explained, “what I’m telling you is that my documents are not what makes me special – it’s the advice behind the documents.”

Doktori goes on to explore whether startups providing free or cheap legal documents, like Shake, Clerky, and Docracy, can "do it better" and ultimately take market share from law firms. This raises an important question: How will firms respond? The answer may partially lie in an anecdote I read recently in Wikinomics.

In the early 1980s, the USPTO began granting patents claiming isolated DNA. This gene sequence data is valuable as it is often the key to researching and developing treatments for blockbuster drugs. By the mid- to late-90s, researchers and industry participants feared that these patents would potentially confer overly broad rights to individual entities and stymie competitive research and development, ultimately creating monopolies on treatments.

While academic debate around this issue centered on the freedom of information, Big Pharma noticed pressure from emerging players in the space: small, biotechnology firms. These biotech firms, often working closely on the cutting edge with academia, leveraged their access to early research to acquire genomic patents. The firms then forced other researchers to pay hefty sums for permissions to their sequences. This strategy ultimately raised costs for Big Pharma, whose foundation is built on drug development and marketing, not horse-trading genetic data.

Rather than wrestle with the biotech companies as a cost of doing business, Merck, a Big Pharma titan, took bold action to render the emerging competition obsolete. In 1995, Merck released 15,000 human gene sequences into the public domain. By 1998, Merck had released around 800,000 sequences. While the release was couched and even praised as a philanthropic gesture aimed at encouraging scientific progress, it crippled biotech companies whose strategy rested on locking up sequence data.

While this example is far different and more complex than the concept of giving away free legal information, it may provide instruction when the question arises: If and when legal startups begin to take noticeable market share from traditional players, how will firms respond?

Like Merck, perhaps firms providing free legal documents have an answer.
