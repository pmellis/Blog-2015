##Patrick Ellis' 2015 Notesand Observations

> *When we study law we are not studying a mystery but a well-known profession.*

My name is Patrick Ellis and I'm a licensed attorney and Legal Project Manager at [Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP](http://www.honigman.com/) in Detroit, MI. I am broadly interested in the intersection of legal operations, business development, technology and access to justice, with a particular focus on legal project management, process improvement and legal analytics.

This repo contains my notes and observations on that intersection.
